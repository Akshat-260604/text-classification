I created a text classification model to analyze sentiments in the IMDB 50k movie review dataset, leveraging machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The process began with data preprocessing, which involved cleaning the text data by removing HTML tags, punctuation, and stop words, and then converting the text to lowercase. 

Using the Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) methods, I converted the textual data into numerical vectors. These vectors served as inputs to the ML models. I experimented with various algorithms, including  Naive Bayes & Random Forest Classifier, optimizing hyperparameters to enhance model performance.

The model training involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Among the tested models, Random Forest demonstrated the highest accuracy in classifying movie reviews as positive or negative.

It's important to note that this project is not end-to-end and is not deployed yet. The current scope includes model development and evaluation, with deployment planned for future phases.
